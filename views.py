def create_views(db_connector: Connection, cursor: Cursor) -> None:
    r"""
    Create database views to simplify queries
    and improve data retrieval efficiency.

    This function generates **SQL views**,
    which are stored queries that allow efficient
    access to faculty information, campus departments, and campus buildings.

    Views Created
    =============
    1. **``faculty_view``**: Combines faculty details
                             with their additional info.
        - **Columns**: All columns from `faculties` and `faculty_info`.

    2. **``campus_departments``**: Lists departments available at each campus.
        - **Columns**: `campus_id`, `department`

    3. **``campus_buildings``**: Lists buildings available at each campus.
        - **Columns**: `campus_id`, `building_id`

    4. **``programme_duration``**: Lists duration (in years)
                                   for each programme.
        - **Columns**: `programme_id`, `duration`

    5. **``section_student_details``**: Lists details of section & students.
        - **Columns**: `section_id`, `student_id`, `campus_id`,
                       `degree`, `stream`, `section`, `year`,
                       `name`, `join_year`, `programme_id`,
                       `roll_no`, `phone_no`

    Parameters
    ==========
    - **db_connector**: Connection
      The database connection object used to interact with the database.

    - **cursor**: Cursor
      A cursor object for executing SQL commands.

    Examples
    =========
    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from Timetable.mysql_connector import connect

        >>> # Create Connection object and Cursor object
        >>> connector, cursor = connect(
                user="root",
                password="secret_pwd",
                host="localhost"
            )

        >>> create_database(connector, cursor)
        >>> create_relations(connector, cursor)
        >>> create_timetable(connector, cursor)
        >>> create_views(connector, cursor)
