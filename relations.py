def create_relations(db_connector: Connection, cursor: Cursor) -> None:
    r"""
    Creates relational constraints for the database by defining additional relations.

    This function establishes foreign keys, uniqueness constraints, and checks on
    relational tables that depend on the previously created schema.

    Parameters
    ==========
    - **db_connector**: Connection
      The database connection object used to interact with the database.

    - **cursor**: Cursor
      A cursor object for executing SQL commands.

    Tables Created
    ==============
    - **``faculty_info``**: Stores salary, and password.
    - **``section_minor_electives``**: Maps minor electives for each section.
    - **``section_class``**: Links sections to classrooms (non-labs).
    - **``section_students``**: Maps students to their sections.
    - **``faculty_section_course``**: Assigns faculties to teach courses in sections.
    - **``student_electives``**: Keeps track of students' elective course selections.

    Examples
    ========
    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from Timetable.mysql_connector import connect

        >>> # Create Connection object and Cursor object
        >>> connector, cursor = connect(
                user="root",
                password="secret_pwd",
                host="localhost"
            )

        >>> create_database(connector, cursor)
        >>> create_relations(connector, cursor)
